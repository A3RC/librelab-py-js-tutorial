### Note
Navigating YouTube for coding tutorials can be overwhelming and often falls short of teaching core fundamentals. Many tutorials claim to cover these essentials but often miss the mark. From my personal experience of wandering through countless ineffective tutorials, I found that Super Simple Dev and Clear Code stand out. Their teaching styles are exceptional, offering numerous exercises that are incredibly helpful for building foundational skills.

If you're into game development or Pygame, Clear Code is a gem, providing comprehensive lessons from basics to advanced concepts of video games and their mechanics. His Python course dives deep into advanced topics like classes, dunder methods, and decorators. As I'm still learning from them, I highly recommend these YouTubers for enhancing your coding skills.
